Future features / ideas:
* configurable host name format
* whitelist / blacklist
* deb package
* user desktop notifications
* ui to toggle whitelist/blacklist 
* completely different package `docker-event-template` (like `consul-template` with a better templating language)
* another os service: hostctl, just for managing the hosts file (with unix socket to communicate over).
* service security
    * https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html#Capabilities
    * CAP_FOWNER ?
